Pero a los científicos todavía les faltan los datos necesarios para estudiar las \n          1,5 millones de especies que existen, y mucho más aún los 7 millones que aún falta por conocer.\n        \n        \n          Resulta difícil que una especie pueda atraer atención o apoyo para su conservación si no se la clasifica en peligro de extinción. \n          Pero si no hay fondos, no se puede estudiar la información necesaria para ver cuál es el riesgo de una especie. Así que para superar \n          esta contradicción, algunos conservacionistas han estado aprovechándose de un recurso que no cuesta nada y que siempre ha estado \n          disponible: el voluntariado.\n        \n        \n          Entre las multitudes del mercado de Lorengau en la Isla Manus, Papúa Nueva Guinea, existe mucho conocimiento — y en particular, \n          datos — que podría tomar meses y miles de dólares para compilar si estuviera a cargo de un equipo de investigación en una expedición \n          en la jungla. Nathan Whitmore, un biólogo enfocado en demografía con la organización Wildlife Conservation Society, estuvo con estas \n          comunidades locales para aprender de “la sabiduría de las multitudes” y para tener una idea sobre la abundancia y la distribución \n          del caracol Manus de árbol (Papustyla pulcherrima).

Esto señala una creciente controversia sobre los controles adecuados y la evaluación \n          de los riesgos de los pesticidas antes de que sean puestos en manos del público.\n        \n        \n          \n            Seguir leyendo\n          \n        \n      \n    `\n  };\n\n  /** Objeto que representa la segunda noticia, incluyendo su contenido y estado de visibilidad */\n  noticia2 = {\n    isOpen: false,\n    content: `\n      \n        \n          Después de muchos años de trabajo, los científicos han calculado el estatus de unas 77.000 especies de plantas \n          y animales en la Lista Roja de animales amenazados de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN). \n          Los datos científicos sobre la distribución y la abundancia de las especies a lo largo del tiempo permiten evaluar cuán cerca \n          está una especie al borde de la extinción. Pero a los científicos todavía les faltan los datos necesarios para estudiar las \n          1,5 millones de especies que existen, y mucho más aún los 7 millones que aún falta por conocer.\n        \n        \n          Resulta difícil que una especie pueda atraer atención o apoyo para su conservación si no se la clasifica en peligro de extinción. \n          Pero si no hay fondos, no se puede estudiar la información necesaria para ver cuál es el riesgo de una especie. Así que para superar \n          esta contradicción, algunos conservacionistas han estado aprovechándose de un recurso que no cuesta nada y que siempre ha estado \n          disponible: el voluntariado.\n        \n        \n          Entre las multitudes del mercado de Lorengau en la Isla Manus, Papúa Nueva Guinea, existe mucho conocimiento — y en particular, \n          datos — que podría tomar meses y miles de dólares para compilar si estuviera a cargo de un equipo de investigación en una expedición \n          en la jungla. Nathan Whitmore, un biólogo enfocado en demografía con la organización Wildlife Conservation Society, estuvo con estas \n          comunidades locales para aprender de “la sabiduría de las multitudes” y para tener una idea sobre la abundancia y la distribución \n          del caracol Manus de árbol (Papustyla pulcherrima). Sus resultados fueron publicados recientemente en la revista Oryx.\n        \n        \n          \n            Seguir leyendo\n          \n        \n      \n    `\n  };\n\n  /** Objeto que representa la tercera noticia, incluyendo su contenido y estado de visibilidad */\n  noticia3 = {\n    isOpen: false,\n    content: `\n      \n        Seguramente, el trabajo de los insectos del mundo llegue a tus labios cada día. El café o el té que saboreas lo han polinizado insectos. Las manzanas, las naranjas, los repollos, las cerezas, las zanahorias, el brócoli, la sandía, el ajo, la canela, la albahaca, las pipas de girasol, las almendras, el aceite de canola… todos son polinizados por los insectos. La miel, los colorantes e incluso algunas vacunas requieren que haya insectos para salir adelante.\n      \n      \n        Son vitales para la red alimentaria del mundo, están alojados en el ciclo de nutrientes e integrados en la industria. Cuanto más los observamos, más vemos que los insectos son vitales para mantener las estructuras de la vida. En referencia a esto, el reconocido biólogo E.O. Wilson escribió en 1987: “Si los insectos desaparecieran, dudo que la especie humana dure más de unos meses”. Por eso, el precipitado declive de los insectos está causando alarma.\n      \n      \n        Las poblaciones de insectos se están reduciendo a un ritmo diferente en el espacio y el tiempo, pero de media, se cree que el descenso en su abundancia es de alrededor de un 1-2 % al año, o un 10-20 % por década.\n      \n      Seguir leyendo\n    `\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Método del ciclo de vida de Angular que se ejecuta cuando el componente se inicializa.\n   * Este método se usa aquí para mostrar la clave de la API, solo con fines de depuración.\n   */\n  ngOnInit() {\n    console.log('API Key:', this.apiKey); \n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Método que alterna la visibilidad del contenido de una noticia específica.\n   * Al hacer clic en una noticia, se cambia su estado de visibilidad entre abierto o cerrado.\n   * \n   * @param {number} noticiaId El ID de la noticia cuyo contenido se quiere alternar\n   */\n  toggleContent(noticiaId: number) {\n    if (noticiaId === 1) {\n      this.noticia1.isOpen = !this.noticia1.isOpen;\n    } else if (noticiaId === 2) {\n      this.noticia2.isOpen = !this.noticia2.isOpen;\n    } else if (noticiaId === 3) {\n      this.noticia3.isOpen = !this.noticia3.isOpen;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n      \n        \n          Insectarium\n          Tienda\n          Guías\n          Contacto          \n          Mi perfil\n          Carrito\n          Blog \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      \n        Últimas llegadas\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              Nuevo crustáceo en tienda: Uca pugilator. ¡Mira qué pinza!\n            \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              ¡Colonias de hormiga bala a la venta!\n            \n          \n        \n      \n  \n      \n        Noticias sobre invertebrados\n      \n        \n    \n        Los pesticidas están diezmando la población de libélulas\n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        Estudiando las especies poco queridas\n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        ¿Peligra la vida en la Tierra a causa de la pérdida de insectos?\n        \n        \n        \n    \n  \n      \n      \n        Curiosidades\n        \n          \n            Insectos en la alimentación: Los insectos desempeñan un papel crucial en la polinización de muchos alimentos que consumimos a diario, como frutas, verduras y especias.\n          \n          \n            La longevidad de algunas especies: Algunos invertebrados como ciertas especies de medusas pueden vivir más de 100 años, mientras que otros, como las libélulas, tienen una vida útil de solo unos meses.\n        \n          \n            Insectos que pueden sobrevivir sin cabeza: Algunos insectos, como las cucarachas, pueden sobrevivir durante días o incluso semanas sin su cabeza debido a su sistema nervioso descentralizado.\n          \n          \n            El aguijón del alacrán: El veneno de un alacrán no solo se utiliza para cazar, sino que también sirve como defensa.

Algunas especies también disfrutan de una ligera neblina de agua durante el día.\n    `\n  };\n\n  // Inyección de ActivatedRoute para acceder a los parámetros de la ruta\n  constructor(@Inject(ActivatedRoute) private route: ActivatedRoute) {}\n\n  /**\n   * Al iniciar el componente, se suscribe a los parámetros de la ruta para identificar qué guía debe abrirse,\n   * basándose en el parámetro 'guide' de la URL.\n   */\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {\n      const guideId = +params['guide'];  // Obtiene el parámetro 'guide' de la URL y lo convierte en número\n      if (guideId === 1) {\n        this.guide1.isOpen = true;  // Abre la guía 1\n      } else if (guideId === 2) {\n        this.guide2.isOpen = true;  // Abre la guía 2\n      } else if (guideId === 3) {\n        this.guide3.isOpen = true;  // Abre la guía 3\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Permite alternar la visibilidad de una guía específica al hacer clic sobre ella.\n   * \n   * @param guideId El ID de la guía a mostrar u ocultar.\n   */\n  toggleContent(guideId: number) {\n    if (guideId === 1) {\n      this.guide1.isOpen = !this.guide1.isOpen;  // Cambia el estado de visibilidad de la guía 1\n    } else if (guideId === 2) {\n      this.guide2.isOpen = !this.guide2.isOpen;  // Cambia el estado de visibilidad de la guía 2\n    } else if (guideId === 3) {\n      this.guide3.isOpen = !this.guide3.isOpen;  // Cambia el estado de visibilidad de la guía 3\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n            \n                Insectarium\n                Tienda\n                Guías\n                Contacto          \n                Mi perfil\n                Carrito\n                Blog \n              \n        \n      \n    \n    \n        \n          Guías sobre Cucarachas\n      \n          \n            Guía 1: ¿Cucarachas?\n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n      \n          \n            Guía 2: Alimentación\n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n      \n          \n            Guía 3: Espacio y Enclosure\n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        Compra cucarachas\n        \n          \n            Pseudoglomeris m.

Para especies pequeñas, un espacio de unos 5×5 cm es suficiente, pero para especies más grandes puede ser necesario un espacio más grande y con suficiente ventilación. Además, se debe asegurar que el sustrato sea lo suficientemente húmedo para mantener la humedad ambiental adecuada.\n      \n      Humedad: Los ciempiés necesitan un nivel de humedad moderado, pero nunca deben estar demasiado mojados. Mantén la mitad del sustrato ligeramente húmedo, especialmente para las crías que pueden deshidratarse rápidamente.\n    `\n  };\n\n  // Inyección de ActivatedRoute para acceder a los parámetros de la ruta\n  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}\n\n  /**\n   * Al iniciar el componente, se suscribe a los parámetros de la ruta para identificar qué guía debe abrirse,\n   * basándose en el parámetro 'guide' de la URL.\n   */\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {\n      const guideId = +params['guide'];

Para los crustáceos marinos, esto incluye agua salada y un entorno acuático adecuado, mientras que los crustáceos de agua dulce necesitan agua dulce y temperaturas moderadas. Los espacios deben tener suficiente superficie para trepar, esconderse y explorar. Asegúrate de proporcionar escondites y áreas de sombra, ya que muchos crustáceos prefieren estar protegidos.\n\n      Humedad: Los crustáceos marinos requieren un ambiente con alta humedad, ya que se deshidratan rápidamente en condiciones secas. Los crustáceos de agua dulce necesitan mantener un nivel constante de humedad en su hábitat acuático. Asegúrate de que el hábitat tenga una buena circulación de agua y que el nivel de humedad se ajuste a la especie.\n    `\n  };\n\n  // Inyección de ActivatedRoute para acceder a los parámetros de la ruta\n  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}\n\n  /**\n   * Al iniciar el componente, se suscribe a los parámetros de la ruta para identificar qué guía debe abrirse,\n   * basándose en el parámetro 'guide' de la URL.\n   */\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {\n      const guideId = +params['guide'];
